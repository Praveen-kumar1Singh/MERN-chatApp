# TalkFlow - A Real-time Chat Application

**TalkFlow** is a real-time, full-stack chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, send messages, and interact with others in real-time. The app is designed to provide a seamless, responsive chat experience with features like user authentication, private messaging, and more.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received instantly with WebSocket support (using Socket.IO).
- **Private Messaging**: Users can send direct messages to one another.
- **Message History**: Users can view message history in the chat interface.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React and styled to be fully responsive across devices.

---

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and message data.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and backend logic.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for the server-side logic.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and secure token-based sessions.
